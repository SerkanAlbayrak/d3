    "text": "Statistical regression techniques are an important concept in data analysis. As a social scientist, I use it to test hypotheses by comparing differences between groups or testing relationships between variables. While it is easy to run regression analyses in a variety of software packages, like SPSS or R, it often remains a black box that is not well understood. I, in fact, do not believe I actually understand regression. Not fully understanding the mechanics of regression could be okay, though. After all, you also don’t need to know exactly how car engines work in order to drive a car. However, I think many users of regression have isolated themselves too much from the mechanics of regression. This may be the source of some errors, such as applying regression to data that is not suitable for the regression method. If you’re using regression to try and make inferences about the world, it’s probably also a good idea to feel like you know what you’re doing.\nSo, there are some reasons to figure out regression. This post is Part 1 of a series of blog posts called ‘Understanding Regression’ in which I try to figure it out.\nFeel free to follow me along by copy-pasting the code from each step. I’ll add a note in case you need to slightly adjust the code for it to work on your computer."

Since I’m a big Pokémon fan, I’ll use a data set containing Pokémon statistics.\nIn case you’re following along, start by loading some packages and reading in the data. In the code section below I use the here package to read in the data, but I recommend that you simply specify the path to the file. After that, I subset the data to make the data a bit more manageable and define a custom mode function because R does not have one (and I need it later)."
